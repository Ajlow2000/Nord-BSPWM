# Ajlow's Dotfiles
Repo for my current dotfiles/workflow.  I currently use BSPWM with a system-wide (is) Nord theme.

# How to Deploy
I use of a program called [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to organize and deploy my dotfiles.  This repo must be cloned into $HOME/ for stow to correctly deploy config files on your system.

## Base Customizations
* Bspwm (Tiling WM)
* Sxhkd (Keybindings)
* Polybar (Status Bar)
* Dunst (Notification server)
* Picom (Compositor_)
* Rofi/Dmenu (Application launcher -- Haven't really picked one I like yet)
* Termite (Terminal Emulator)
* Neovim (Editor)
* GTK (Imports themes (Nord) -- set with lxappearance)
* Zsh (Shell of choice)
* Bash (Default shell on most systems)
* Posix (A generalized place for shortcuts that work with any posix compliant shell{?})
* Scripts (~/.local/scripts/)

## Misc Customizations
* Spicetify [Nord theme](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes)
* RTV (Reddit Terminal Viewer)
